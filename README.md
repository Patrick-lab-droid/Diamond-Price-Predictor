Diamond Price Prediction API ðŸ’Žâš¡ â€” A machine learning project that predicts diamond prices based on features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). The trained model is deployed with FastAPI, enabling users to send diamond attributes through REST API endpoints and receive real-time price predictions in JSON format. This project demonstrates how to integrate ML models with modern APIs, making it practical for automated pricing, valuation systems, or educational purposes.
